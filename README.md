### Hello there! 👋

For the last 11 years, I have been mainly involved in integrated circuits (ICs) design ([Institute of Microelectronics and Photonics](https://imif.lukasiewicz.gov.pl/en/) and [Institute of High Pressure Physics](https://www.unipress.waw.pl/index.php?lang=en)). **BUT...!**

Now it's time for **Data Science**! I started my postgraduate diploma at Warsaw University of Technology: *"Data Science – algorithms, tools and applications for Big Data problems"*. Friendship ended with CADENCE❌, now Python🐍 is my best friend 💖

My other new friends:
- RStudio💙
- Jupyter💛 
- Git💚
- SQL ➡️💜 (in progress)
